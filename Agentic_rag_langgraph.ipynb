Many criminal operations take part in corruption, black marketeering, terrorism and abduction. Other forms of crime done by criminal groups are arms trafficking, export of contraband oil and metals, and smuggling of radioactive materials. Crime rate in Russia sharply increased since the late 1980s. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe had tremendous influence on the political economy of organized crime. Approximately 8,000 criminal groups are in the country. Almost 50% of the nation's economy is connected to organized crime. Drug trafficking and illegal drug use is a big problem in the nation. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, the civil war in Afghanistan, the civil war in Tajikistan, and the conflicts in the North Caucasus have made the favorable conditions for the development of illegal drug trade. But measures have been taken to fight drug trafficking. Russia is a party of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. In March 2003, Russian President Vladimir Putin established the Russian State Committee for Control over the Illegal Trafficking of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances for combating drug trafficking with more coordinated manner.\"},\n",

It got very good reviews and sold very well. The game\\'s story is about a man who is in a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean and finds a lighthouse in the middle of the sea, which takes him to an underwater city created by a man named Andrew Ryan called Rapture, which is home to many violent creatures called Splicers, who are people became insane because of mutation. \"BioShock\" is set during 1960, in Rapture, a fictional underwater city. The player learns about Rapture by listening to voice recordings. Rapture was created by a man called Andrew Ryan, who did not like the political, economic, and religious powers that existed over land. He wanted Rapture to be a place where people could do and become whatever they wanted. The city was secretly built in 1946 on a mid-Atlantic seabed, using submarine volcanoes to give geothermal power. Scientific progress grew in Rapture because there were no governments or religious organizations that could put limits on research. This was how Ryan brought many brilliant scientists into the city. This led to fast developments in engineering and biotechnology. These scientists also discovered ADAM, stem cells harvested from an unknown species of sea slug, which were discovered by Dr. Bridgette Tenenbaum to have the ability to heal damaged tissue and rewrite the human genome. Tenenbaum joined with businessman and mobster Frank Fontaine to create the plasmid industry, which offered superhuman physical enhancements to its customers. Tenenbaum found that ADAM could be mass-produced by implanting the slugs in the stomachs of young girls (\"Little Sisters\"), taken from orphanages founded by Fontaine. As time passed, the gap between rich and poor increased. Frank Fontaine created charity organizations to support the underclass. His goal was to use his charity organizations to manipulate the poor. He also made a smuggling operation to supply citizens with forbidden items from the surface, such as religious material. These, along with his control of the plasmid industry, made him immensely powerful. He tried to overthrow Ryan, but the revolt was violently crushed and Fontaine was said to be dead. Ryan seized control of Fontaine\\'s plasmid business. Within a few months, a new figure named Atlas rose as the leader of the disgruntled lower class. On New Year\\'s Eve of 1959, Atlas and his ADAM-infused followers began a new revolt against Ryan that spread throughout Rapture. Ryan in turn began splicing his own forces, and his paranoia had reached such a level he was hanging dozens of people, mostly innocent, in Rapture\\'s main square. In order to solve ADAM shortages, the Little Sisters were mentally conditioned to wander the city and extract ADAM from the dead, recycling it into raw ADAM in their stomachs after swallowing it. \"Big Daddies\", enhanced and mentally sterilized humans in armored diving suits, were created by Dr. Suchong, the scientist behind many plasmids, to protect the Little Sisters in their work.'},\n",

To do this, the Coast Guard uses boats, ships, helicopters and airplanes to stop smuggling and other crime and terrorism, and to rescue ships and boats in danger.

In 1915, President Woodrow Wilson signed the \"Act to Create the Coast Guard\". This designated the United States Coast Guard as a branch of the US military. It was formed by merging the Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service. Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury suggested the creation of the Revenue Cutter Service in a letter dated October 2, 1789. After being approved by Congress, the service started with 10 boats called cutters. At the time a cutter was a small fast sailing vessel described as \"a small, decked ship with one mast and bowsprit, with a gaff mainsail on a boom, a square yard and topsail, and two jibs or a jib and a staysail.\" Before the Revenue Cutter Service began, the Continental Navy had been disbanded. Until the United States Navy was formed in 1794, the Revenue Cutter Service was the nation\\'s only naval force. After the American Revolutionary War, the United States was struggling financially. The new country depended on the money it received from import tariffs. Smuggling had been seen as a patriotic duty during the war, but was now a robbing the country of one of its major sources of revenue. Hamilton realized that if something was not done quickly, the country would suffer financially. He suggested that a fleet of 10 cutters could collect revenues and prevent smuggling.'},\n",

Thousands of years ago an asteroid crashes into an African country called Wakanda containing an alien metal called vibranium which absorbs vibrations and is the world’s strongest metal as a result. The tribes of Wakanda went to war for the vibranium but then decided to unite under the leadership of a king called the Black Panther. Only one tribe goes into exile in the mountains of Wakanda so that they do not have to be ruled by the Black Panther. Because of using vibranium to make weapons the Wakandans managed to stop anyone else from ever conquering their country and as a result they became the world’s most technologically advanced nation but kept that a secret from everyone else by creating a giant force field around the country and having no relationship with the outside world. Then in the late 20th century T’chaka, King of Wakanda finds out that his brother who is an undercover spy in the United States is secretly smuggling vibranium to the US to help oppressed black people to overthrow the white man. T’chaka then kills his brother and leaves his body unburied to return to Wakanda. T’chaka’s brother’s son finds his father’s body dead and swears to get revenge. Then in 2018, T’chaka’s son T’challa comes back to Wakanda to become the new king following T’chaka’s murder in the movie . M’baku comes from the mountains and challenges T’challa to a fight to become Black Panther. T’challa wins and convinces M’Baku to surrender so that he doesn’t have to kill him. T’challa’s cousin turns out to have joined the American army and worked as an assassin for the CIA known as Killmonger. He since left the CIA and hired a supervillain named Klaue to help him rob the British Museum of its Wakandan artifacts and then murder everyone there. T’challa finds out that Klaue is in South Korea and goes there as the Black Panther to try and capture him only to find himself fighting the CIA. Klaue is captured by CIA agent Everett Ross with T’challa’s help and Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda is actually a rich country. Klaue escapes with Killmonger’s help and Ross is hurt. T’challa takes Ross to Wakanda so that his doctors can fix him. Killmonger then gets Klaue to take him to Wakanda only to reveal to Klaue that he is actually a Wakandan prince and kills Klaue. He then delivers Klaue’s body to Wakanda in exchange for an audience with T’challa and demand the throne. Killmonger and T’challa fight to the death and Killmonger wins. Killmonger becomes King of Wakanda and then wants to use the Wakandan military to conquer all white people in the world and punish them for their crimes against black people. T’challa’s family reaches out to M’baku and asks him to fight Killmonger. M’baku reveals that T’challa survived the fight without having surrendered and that he rescued an injured T’challa to repay him for having spared his life. T’challa is healed by M’baku and T’challa confronts Killmonger. Killmonger has no plan to fight T’challa since he believes that now that he is king there is no need for violence. T’challa tries to get the throne back by fighting to the death against Killmonger and wins. T’challa then decides to share Wakanda’s technology with the world.

With the landing and advance of General Douglas MacArthur in late 1944, it was feared the Japanese would move the prisoners to Japan or kill them. On January 30, 1945, during World War II, United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts, and Filipino guerrillas liberated 511 prisoners from the camp. The daring raid is still studied by Army Rangers today as a classic example. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941, the United States declared war on Japan and its allies. At the same time the Japanese also attacked the American bases at Guam, Wake Island and the Philippines. While Guam and Wake Island soon fell, Filipino and U.S. forces resisted in the Philippines until early May 1942. By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia. The Bataan peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region. On April 9, 1942 about 11,800 American, 66,000 Filipino and 1,000 Chinese-Filipinos surrendered to the Japanese. They were starving, sick and fatigued, yet were forced to march 60 miles (97 km) with many dying along the way. This was the infamous Bataan Death March. Many also escaped and joined guerrilla forces hiding in the mountains. About 79,000 survived and were imprisoned at Camp O\\'Donnell. The American and Filipino forces on Island of Corregidor surrendered on May 6, 1942. The approximately 79,000 forces captured on Corregidor were not a part of the Death March. They were loaded onto cargo ships and taken to Manila. There they were marched through the streets as a celebration of the Japanese victory. They were then sent to Cabanatuan camp number 1 near Cabanatuan city. They were joined by other American prisoners from Camp O\\'Donnell. By January of 1945, after nearly three years at the camp, nearly 3,000 prisoners had died. The camp measured about by and was enclosed by 3 barbed wire fences, each high. There were guard towers outside the fence. The prisoners were kept in 8 barracks originally designed to house 40 soldiers, but were used to hold 120 prisoners each. Conditions at the camp in 1942 were terrible with mosquitoes that carried malaria and flies that spreading dysentery. Many prisoners were murdered by the guards. Local Filipinos smuggled in food and money to bribe the guards. But by 1944 the conditions became worse. The Japanese cut rations and cut down on the smuggling of food to prisoners. They started sending prisoners to camps in Japan and Manchuria in \"hellships\". By early 1945 just over 500 prisoners were left in Cabanatuan number 1 camp.'}]"

The game\\'s story is about a man who is in a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean and finds a lighthouse in the middle of the sea, which takes him to an underwater city created by a man named Andrew Ryan called Rapture, which is home to many violent creatures called Splicers, who are people became insane because of mutation. \"BioShock\" is set during 1960, in Rapture, a fictional underwater city. The player learns about Rapture by listening to voice recordings. Rapture was created by a man called Andrew Ryan, who did not like the political, economic, and religious powers that existed over land. He wanted Rapture to be a place where people could do and become whatever they wanted. The city was secretly built in 1946 on a mid-Atlantic seabed, using submarine volcanoes to give geothermal power. Scientific progress grew in Rapture because there were no governments or religious organizations that could put limits on research. This was how Ryan brought many brilliant scientists into the city. This led to fast developments in engineering and biotechnology. These scientists also discovered ADAM, stem cells harvested from an unknown species of sea slug, which were discovered by Dr. Bridgette Tenenbaum to have the ability to heal damaged tissue and rewrite the human genome. Tenenbaum joined with businessman and mobster Frank Fontaine to create the plasmid industry, which offered superhuman physical enhancements to its customers. Tenenbaum found that ADAM could be mass-produced by implanting the slugs in the stomachs of young girls (\"Little Sisters\"), taken from orphanages founded by Fontaine. As time passed, the gap between rich and poor increased. Frank Fontaine created charity organizations to support the underclass. His goal was to use his charity organizations to manipulate the poor. He also made a smuggling operation to supply citizens with forbidden items from the surface, such as religious material. These, along with his control of the plasmid industry, made him immensely powerful. He tried to overthrow Ryan, but the revolt was violently crushed and Fontaine was said to be dead. Ryan seized control of Fontaine\\'s plasmid business. Within a few months, a new figure named Atlas rose as the leader of the disgruntled lower class. On New Year\\'s Eve of 1959, Atlas and his ADAM-infused followers began a new revolt against Ryan that spread throughout Rapture. Ryan in turn began splicing his own forces, and his paranoia had reached such a level he was hanging dozens of people, mostly innocent, in Rapture\\'s main square. In order to solve ADAM shortages, the Little Sisters were mentally conditioned to wander the city and extract ADAM from the dead, recycling it into raw ADAM in their stomachs after swallowing it. \"Big Daddies\", enhanced and mentally sterilized humans in armored diving suits, were created by Dr. Suchong, the scientist behind many plasmids, to protect the Little Sisters in their work.'),\n",

It got very good reviews and sold very well. The game\\'s story is about a man who is in a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean and finds a lighthouse in the middle of the sea, which takes him to an underwater city created by a man named Andrew Ryan called Rapture, which is home to many violent creatures called Splicers, who are people became insane because of mutation. \"BioShock\" is set during 1960, in Rapture, a fictional underwater city. The player learns about Rapture by listening to voice recordings. Rapture was created by a man called Andrew Ryan, who did not like the political, economic, and religious powers that existed over land. He wanted Rapture to be a place where people could do and become whatever they wanted. The city was secretly built in 1946 on a mid-Atlantic seabed, using submarine volcanoes to give geothermal power. Scientific progress grew in Rapture because there were no governments or religious organizations that could put limits on research. This was how Ryan brought many brilliant scientists into the city. This led to fast developments in engineering and biotechnology. These scientists also discovered ADAM, stem cells harvested from an unknown species of sea slug, which were discovered by Dr. Bridgette Tenenbaum to have the ability to heal damaged tissue and rewrite the human genome. Tenenbaum joined with businessman and mobster Frank Fontaine to create the plasmid industry, which offered superhuman physical enhancements to its customers. Tenenbaum found that ADAM could be mass-produced by implanting the slugs in the stomachs of young girls (\"Little Sisters\"), taken from orphanages founded by Fontaine. As time passed, the gap between rich and poor increased. Frank Fontaine created charity organizations to support the underclass. His goal was to use his charity organizations to manipulate')]"

This is when ships from Bimini in the western Bahamas transported cheap rum to Florida to be sold illegally. But there was little profit in cheap rum. They soon started smuggling Canadian whisky, French champagne, and English gin to major cities like New York City and Boston. This gave them a high profit. It was said that some ships carried $200,000 worth of alcohol in a single trip. \"Bootlegging\" usually means smuggling over land. It is thought the term \"bootlegging\" started during the American Civil War. Soldiers would sneak liquor into army camps by hiding bottles of liquor in their boots or under their trouser legs.']"

            "Smuggling refers to the illegal transportation of goods, objects, substances, or information across state, national, or international borders. This activity is often undertaken to avoid tariffs, taxes, or legal restrictions imposed by governments. Smuggling can involve a wide range of items, including weapons, alcohol, drugs, and even information.\n",

            "There are several motivations for people to engage in smuggling:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Economic Gain**: The primary motivation for smuggling is often financial profit. By evading taxes and tariffs, smugglers can sell goods at a lower price or pocket the difference, leading to significant profits. For example, during the Prohibition era in the United States, rum-runners and bootleggers smuggled alcohol to evade prohibition laws and taxes, making substantial profits by selling these goods illegally.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Avoidance of Legal Restrictions**: Smugglers may transport goods that are illegal or heavily restricted in certain areas. For instance, arms trafficking involves the illegal smuggling of weapons and ammunition, often to regions experiencing political conflict or civil war, where such items are in high demand but restricted.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Supply and Demand**: In some cases, smuggling is driven by the demand for certain goods that are not readily available or are illegal in a particular region. This demand creates a lucrative market for smugglers who can supply these goods.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Political or Ideological Reasons**: Some individuals or groups may engage in smuggling to support a political cause or ideology, such as smuggling arms to support a rebel group in a conflict zone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, smuggling is a complex issue influenced by economic, legal, and social factors, and it poses significant challenges to law enforcement and regulatory agencies worldwide.\n"
